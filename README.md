# dimention_reduction_test

Dimention reduction is a commonly used method in RNAseq analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are popular dimention reduction methods. In this project, I used R and python to run all above four dimention-reduction models for the same dataset to test their efficiency of clustering. 

The dataset I used is called Sign Language MNIST, and it can be accessed here:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist

Platform I used is: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)
R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) -- "Funny-Looking Kid"
Python 3.9.6 

When I use R, the time consuming for the four models are:
tSNE > UMAP > LDA > PCA. (You can check the specific time elapse in the html file.)
Based on the results generated by R, I think LDA performed the best among the four. tSNE is not that bad in clustering, but it takes the longest time.

When I use python, the time consuming for the four models are:
tSNE(16.0s) > UMAP (9.4s) > PCA (4.3s) > LDA (1.5s).
Same with ruslts of R, LDA perform the clustering the best among the four I think. 
Of course, python is much faster than R, even though the PCA and LDA use linear transformation.
